# AI Fitness Coach – AI-Native Training Recommendation Platform

AI-powered coaching platform that generates **adaptive workout and nutrition recommendations** using Large Language Models (LLMs), contextual user data, and historical training signals.

The system combines **user state modeling, contextual prompts, memory, and retrieval-based knowledge** to generate personalized daily training recommendations.

This project demonstrates how modern AI systems can integrate **data pipelines, LLM reasoning, and intelligent orchestration** to build adaptive fitness applications.

---

## Overview

Traditional fitness programs rely on static training plans. The AI Fitness Coach replaces this approach with a **dynamic AI-driven recommendation engine**.

The system evaluates multiple user signals each day, including:

- Sleep quality
- Adherence to diet
- Motivation levels
- Historical workouts
- Body metrics
- Recovery indicators

Using this contextual information, the platform generates **personalized daily workout recommendations** through LLM reasoning.

The result is a coaching system capable of adapting training intensity, recovery strategies, and workout selection dynamically.

## AI System Architecture

The platform is designed as an **AI-native system** combining contextual state, memory, retrieval, and LLM reasoning.

## Core System Components

### Context Builder

Aggregates all contextual information used by the AI system.

Inputs include:

- User profile
- Body measurements
- Training history
- Daily check-in signals
- Previous recommendations

The Context Builder generates the **AI context package** used by downstream components.

---

### User State Engine

Transforms raw inputs into structured readiness indicators.

Examples of derived signals:

- Recovery score
- Fatigue score
- Adherence score
- Training load
- Readiness classification

These indicators help determine whether the user should perform:

- Intense training
- Moderate workout
- Recovery session

---

### Memory Layer

Stores historical information used to personalize recommendations over time.

Examples of stored data:

- Previous workouts
- Adherence trends
- Historical recommendations
- Performance improvements
- Long-term training patterns

The memory layer enables the system to behave like a **coach with historical awareness**.

---

### Training Knowledge Base (RAG)

The system includes a retrieval-based knowledge layer containing structured training information.

Examples of knowledge sources:

- Exercise catalog
- Training guidelines
- Recovery rules
- Intensity recommendations
- Workout video catalog

This allows the AI to retrieve reliable training rules before generating a recommendation.

---

### Coach Agent

The **Coach Agent** acts as the decision-making orchestrator.

Responsibilities include:

- Analyzing user readiness
- Selecting the training strategy
- Retrieving relevant exercises
- Determining workout intensity
- Preparing context for the LLM

This component enables the system to behave more like an **AI planning system** rather than a simple chatbot.

---

### Prompt Engine

Builds structured prompts combining:

- Contextual user state
- Retrieved training knowledge
- Historical training signals
- Exercise availability

The Prompt Engine ensures the model receives **structured and reliable context**.

---

### LLM Reasoning Layer

The LLM generates the final training recommendation.

Example outputs include:

- Daily workout plan
- Exercise selection
- Training duration
- Intensity level
- Coaching message

Example structured output:

```json
{
  "workout_plan": "Full Body Moderate Training",
  "duration_minutes": 45,
  "intensity": "moderate",
  "exercises": [
    "bodyweight squats",
    "push-ups",
    "plank",
    "jump rope"
  ],
  "coach_message": "You reported moderate recovery today. Focus on controlled movement and maintain consistent pacing."
}
```

---

### Evaluation Layer

Before persisting recommendations, the system validates the output.

Validation includes:

- Safety checks
- Intensity boundaries
- Exercise availability
- Recovery constraints
- Overtraining prevention

This prevents unsafe or unrealistic recommendations.

---
